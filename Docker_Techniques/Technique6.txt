Topic: Using ports to connect to containers

Step 1: Pull some image from from the repo(docker hub)
docker pull wordpress
docker images

Step 2: Map the port 10001 to port 80
docker run -p 10001:80 wordpress
(80 is the port where wordpress by default listens to)

Step 3: Verify by navigating to http://localhost:10001 using a browser
