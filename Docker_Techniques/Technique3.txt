Topic: Moving Docker to a different partition
By deafult docker stores everything in /var/lib/docker

Step 1: Stop the docker service
suod systemctl stop docker 

Step 2: Move the contens of Docker to a different locatin
sudo dockerd --date-root /home/1rv24mc045_ryan/mydocker
--data-root specifies where docker should store its internal files 
The above command takes over the terminal, use ctrl+c to exit

In another temrinal,
Step 3: Start the docker service
sudo systemctl start docker.service (or just docker)

Step 4: Check the folder creation and contents by navigating into the directory
sudo sudo
cd /hone/1rv24mc045_ryan/mydocker
