Topic: Open you docker daemon to the world

Step 1 : Check the status of docker
sudo sytemctl status docker

Step 2 : Open the systemd file of docker
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/docker.service
The above is the service definition file, it defines how docker deamon starts i.e what commands, arguments etc.


Step 3: Comment the containerd.sock code 
sudo cat .......(as above)
The above commented code tells docker to communicate via the Unix socket. It only lets local communication.

Step 4 : Add the code to the systemd file
"ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H=fd://tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
The above code tell docker to listen over TCP on port 2375

Step 5: Reload the daemon and restart docker
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker

Step 6: Check IP of the host
ifconfig

Step 7: Open http://ip:2375/images/json in browser to view the docker images.

The Docker API on tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 is completely unauthenticated and unencrypted by default.
Anyone with access to that port can:
Run arbitrary containers (POST /containers/create)
Remove all images (DELETE /images)
Access your filesystem through container mounts
Essentially gain root-level control over your host
