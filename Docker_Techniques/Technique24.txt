Topic: Intelligent cache busting using add directive

Step 1: Create a docker file 
FROM debian..
.....

Step 2: insert the ADD command for a online file
ADD online_url /location

Step 3: Build the image
docker build .

Step 4 : List the images 

The above is partially true, when you use ADD with a local file, docker calculates the checksum and if the file contents change, docker invalidates cache for the next build, 
but for online url , docker calculates checksum of the url, not the contents of the url, therefore the above technique is outdated, lol.
