Topic: Inteligent cache -bustin using Build-Args

Step 1 : Create a dockerfile

Step 2: Add a custom cache invalidation

From debian
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y update
ARG CACHEBUST=1
RUN echo ["welcome"]

Step 3: Build the image with cache bust as a paramter to set a different value making all layers be rebuilt
sudo docker build -t ...--build-arg CACHEBUST=$(date +%s) .

What we basically do is we create a variable at a point in the build, whose value we change during the build process, because of which docker detects a change, and rebuilds subsequent layers rather than using the cache.
